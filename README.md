# DS2DPR


Hello. This is a simple program that creates a discord rich presence for DarkSoulsII: SoTFS. It tracks deaths and session play time and hides comfortably in 
your toolbar. Very simple to use. Unfortunately, I couldnt get this to work as a standalone exe. For some reason, if it was one, it would just refuse to launch.
 I suspect system.windows.forms could maybe be responible but I really dont know
